## Introduction
Dive into the heart of the C programming galaxy with CUniverse! This repository is your interstellar guide, filled with stellar code and resources that propel you into the boundless wonders of C. As the cosmic explorer, I may not be an expert, but together, we'll navigate the uncharted territories of C, learning and growing with each orbit.

Are you ready to embark on this cosmic adventure? Contribute, collaborate, and let's collectively navigate the C Cosmos. Whether you're a seasoned spacefarer or a budding astronaut, your contributions will shape this cosmic repository.

## Getting Started
To commence your journey through the C Cosmos, follow these steps: -

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CUniverse-Exploring-C-Cosmos.git
    ```

2. Explore the directories and choose the project or example you are interested in.

3. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README for building and running the code.

## Directory Structure
Explore the constellations of `/Basics of C language`, `/Advance C Programming`traverse the galaxies of `/projects`. Together, we'll create a celestial atlas of C programming excellence.

The repository is organized as follows: -

- `/Basics Intro`: Contains a simple intro about Creator of this repository.
- `/Basics of C language`: Contains small C programming examples for learning specific concepts.
- `/C projects`: Houses larger C projects that demonstrate practical applications of the language.
- `/Advance C Programming`: Contains Advance C programming examples for learning more advanced concepts from Different Resources on internet.

Feel free to contribute by adding more examples, projects, or improving existing ones.
